Next Steps
----------

In the walkthrough, we performed naive sequential alignment of a single block using ``corgie align-block`` command without using distributed workers.

To perform alignment of long stacks using ABCD alignment globalization, refer to :ref:`align command <align command>` documentation.

To perform alignment using distributed workers, refer to :ref:`distributed computation <distributed computation>` section.
